# python-guessword-game

This is a Python script for a word guessing game where the user can choose from three categories: coding languages, company names, and animal names. The program will randomly select a word from the chosen category and prompt the user to guess it within a specific number of attempts. The user will be given feedback on whether their guess is correct or not, and the program will keep track of the number of attempts it took to guess the word correctly. The user can quit the game anytime by entering 'q'.
